        <p>Steven Paul Jobs is born in San Francisco to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali. The
            then-unmarried couple give up their son to adoption. Paul and Clara Jobs become Jobs' non-biological
            parents. Here's a brief timeline of his life achivements:</p>
    </h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>1976</h4>
            <p  style="padding-left: 10px;">Co-founds Apple Computer with Wozniak and Ronald Wayne.

        <li>
            <h4>June 5, 1977</h4>
            <p  style="padding-left: 10px;">Releases the Apple II, the first commercially available personal computer in a plastic case 
                with color graphics--and Apple's first successful personal computer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>January 24, 1984</h4>
            <p  style="padding-left: 10px;">Two days after the $1.5 million Ridley Scott-directed "1984" Super Bowl commercial airs, introduces the Macintosh to much fanfare during Apple's shareholder meeting.
                "For the first time ever, I'd like to let Macintosh speak for itself." The computer's voice then says, "Never trust a computer you can't lift.
                " Macintosh becomes the first commercially successful small computer with a graphical user interface.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>September 12, 1985</h4>
            <p  style="padding-left: 10px;">CEO John Sculley engineers Jobs' ouster from Apple. Jobs resigns as Apple chairman, saying in a board meeting, "I've been thinking a lot, and it's time for me to get on with my life.
                 It's obvious that I've got to do something. I'm 30 years old." Soon thereafter, Jobs starts NeXT Computer (which later becomes NeXT Software), funded by selling $70 million of his Apple stock.
                 An "interpersonal" NeXT workstation, sporting a built-in Ethernet port, is used by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN to become the first server of the World Wide Web.</p>

               The film earns $192 million at the box office. Its success helps make it quite attractive for celebrities to lend their voices to animated characters. </p>
